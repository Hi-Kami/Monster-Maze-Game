# Monster-Maze-Game
A procedurally generated monster maze game where you hunt ghost hunters as a ghost.

# What I learned
* Time constraints, game was for a game jam where you created a game over a month that was procedually generated. I dedicated 2 hours a day over the course of a month.
* To avoid feature creap, I did have ideas for more features and better systems in the game but due to time constraints I focused on the basics to make a completed game.
