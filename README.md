# Monster-Maze-Game
A procedurally generated monster maze game where you scare ghost hunters as a ghost by sneaking up behind them.

# What I learned
* Time constraints, game was for a game jam where you created a game over a month that was procedually generated. I dedicated 2 hours a day over the course of a month.
* To avoid feature creap, I did have ideas for more features and better systems in the game but due to time constraints I focused on the basics to make a completed game.

# How I could improve
* Because of time constraints I had to limit features, for example I had a color change system implemented and you can hide in walls of similar color however there was plans for enemys of certain colors too and you could only scare them when you was that color. So I would implement some more of the color mechanics.
* The art was done quickly for testing so I would go back and make it better and make it look a little less flat.
* Sound was completely neglected in this project so I would add sound effects and maybe some spooky music.
